### Results

#### Model Accuracy

We ran 7 different models against both the baseline set of features and extended features. Models trained against the baseline features did not achieve high accuracy, with the range in accuracy across all the models falling between 76% and 79%.

When trained and tested against the extended data, however, the accuracy significantly improved for all models and ranged between 89% and 99%.
Even the Logistic Regression Classifier, though the worst performer, had a 6% improvement in accuracy just by adding the extended fields.
We chose the AdaBoostClassifier because it achieved the highest accuracy, had fast prediction, and at a depth of 2 can still be interpreted.

This table summarizes the progressive improvement in accuracy among all the datasets.

#### NLP Features Improve Bot Detection

Based on the results of our testing, we assess that including NLP features engineered from the tweet text improved Bot Detection. These Online Social Platforms are built for users to communicate ideas, so capturing deeper language patterns in the tweet text itself, in combination with metrics about the reaction to the tweets and users (likes, retweets, etc), and other activity can improve bot detection.

#### Future Work
 There are still many unexplored ideas that we have yet to explore. For example, we read research indicating that analyzing the
 temporal nature of tweet activity can uncover bot behaviors. It would be interesting to explore these temporal patterns in user
 behavior and again extend these with NLP to see if Tweet Topics have temporal patterns. By accurately mimicking the characteristics
 of genuine users, these "smart" spam bots are able to evade detection. Many experiments have shown that neither humans nor
 state-of-the-art spam bot detection applications manage to accurately detect this new wave of spam bots. There are new techniques
 on the horizon that are more effective to detect these smart bots. Here are a few from recent research should be investigated further.
 It should make our detection bot model even more effective to combat these "evil" Twitter bots [5].

 - detection of lockstep behavior

 - anomalies in synchronicity and normality

 - detection of loosely synchronized actions

 - detection  of latent group anomalies in graphs

 - the distance between distributions of reputation scores

 - the similarity between digital DNA sequence.
