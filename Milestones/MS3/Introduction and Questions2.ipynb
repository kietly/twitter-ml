    "Twitter is an Online Social Networking (OSN) platform where users can broadcast messages, images and videos in 280 characters or less. Investigations have uncovered Twitter users who buy followers to give the “appearance of social influence…to bolster political activism, business endeavors or entertainment careers.”[1] In some cases, these types of accounts also engaged in nefarious activity like disinformation, and promoting propaganda. In response to pressure from Government and advertising customers to reduce this type of social media fraud, Twitter started a campaign in July 2018 that removed suspicious follower accounts, about 6% of all users. [1].\n",

    "Data Collection\n",
    "We contacted researchers who gave us access to their dataset consisting of verified human twitter accounts, which we will call genuine accounts, and bot accounts. Each dataset of genuine and bot accounts consisted of two files: one file of tweets and a second file listing summary statistics about the users who generated the tweets.\n",
